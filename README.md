# Simon Says Game

The Simon Says Game is a memory-based challenge designed to test and improve your cognitive abilities. It is built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my frontend web development skills by creating a fully responsive, interactive, and engaging game.

## Features
- Fully responsive design
- Engaging and interactive gameplay
- Increasing difficulty with each level
- Score display upon game over

## How to Play

1. **Press the start button to begin the game.**
2. **Pay attention to the pattern** presented on the screen. The game will highlight a sequence of buttons.
3. **Repeat the pattern** by pressing the buttons in the correct order.
4. **With each successful sequence**, the game becomes more challenging as the length of the pattern increases.

## Gameplay Rules

- After each complete sequence, your level will increase by one.
- If you press a button that is not part of the sequence, the game will be over, and your score will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
